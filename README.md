Benefits of KPRA IMS
Implementation of IMS will have the following benefits:
-The population pyramid of Pakistan represents a large youth proportion and our government is not using that youth in positive way and not providing them opportunity for development, this situation creates frustration in youth that leads them towards conflict, unrest and violence. The project is expected to create job opportunities which is a key agenda of the PTI government.
-The project may provide a stimulus to the economy and is expected to generate a boost to hospitality industry operations, cause additional guest spending at restaurants and stores in the travel destination, and increase hotel capital investmentâ€”all benefitting the broader provincial economy.
-More hotel guests mean more spending in local communities, including stores, restaurants, and attractions. That would also contribute to higher state and local tax revenues, including occupancy and sales taxes.
-Through IMS actual sale invoices will be saved in KPRA database which will help in identifying the actual sale of the service providers and charge the exact amount of sales tax on services from the service provider.
-IMS will digitize the collection of sales tax on services and reduce the need of HR resources necessary for visiting the service providers to monitor tax.
-Through IMS, KPRA can monitor every service provider online and hence can cover all service providers across KP.
-The Tax Internees and IMS will promote tax culture in KPK.  
-IMS will increase the revenue by making the tax collection transparent and accountable.
-IMS will increase the revenue by extending the outreach of KPRA to service providers across KPK as visits of HR resources will be reduced.
